\section{Introduction}
The transport of photon and electron has a lot of applications in medical
physics and paticularly in radiotherapy. The radiotherapy consists in sending
X-ray on a cancerous tumor in order to destroy it. The photons interact in the
body producing electrons by photo-electric effect. These electrons destroy the
cells and produce secondary photons. It is important to know accurately what
is the dose sent. The dose has to be large enough in the tumor to kill the
cancerous but as small as possible in the healthy cells. To compute this dose,
several methods can be applied :
\begin{description}
\item[Analytic methods,] very fast but inacurrate
\item[Deterministic method,] fast and acurrate but needs a lot of memory
\item[Monte-Carlo,] very acurrate but slow to converge.
\end{description}
In this work, we will present a $S_n$ method for the photon-electron
transport. The difficulty of this calculation comes from the transport of the
electrons. The electrons are charged particles and thus, they have very
anisotropic scattering. This anisotropy creates some problems since the
standard Legendre expansion to represent the cross-sections would require
hundreds of terms. A common approximation is to replace the Boltzmann equation
by the Boltzmann-Fokker-Planck equation. These equation consists in adding in
2 terms: one causes to particles to redistribute in energy change and the
other to redistribute in energy without directional\cite{morel_81}. This
allows to keep the Legendre expansion of the cross-section to a low order.
