\section{Equations}                                                      
In this section, we will present the equation which models the transport of
electron. We will also show why it is so important to use the Galerkin
quadrature. The transport equation for neutral particle is given by :
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\bo \cdot \bn \Psi(\br,\bo,E) + \Sigma_t(\br,E) \Psi(\br,\bo,E) &=
\int_{4\pi}\int_0^{\infty} \Sigma_s\(\br,\bo \cdot \bo',E'\rightarrow E\)
\Psi(\br,\bo',E')dE'd\bo'\\
& + Q(\br,\bo,E)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where : 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Psi$ is the angular flux 
\item $\Sigma_t$ is the total macroscopic cross section
\item $\Sigma_s$ is the macroscopic differential scattering cross section
\item Q is a volumetric source
\end{itemize} 
As stated above, we will replace this equation by the
Boltzmann-Fokker-Planck equation (BFP). The idea is to decompose the highly forward
peaked scattering cross section into a sum of a forward-peaked cross section
and a smooth cross section. The BFP equation is given by (the variables are
omitted for brevity) \cite{morel_96} :
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\bo \cdot \bn \Psi + \Sigma_t \Psi &= \int_{4\pi}\int_0^{\infty} \Sigma_s\(\bo
\cdot \bo',E'\rightarrow E\) \Psi(\bo',E')dE'd\bo'\\
& + \frac{\alpha}{2}
\(\frac{\partial}{\partial \mu} \(1-\mu^2\) \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \mu}
+ \frac{1}{1-\mu^2} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial \phi}\) +
\frac{\partial S\Psi}{\partial E}  + Q
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\mu$ is the cosine of the directional azimuthal angle and $\phi$ is the
directional azimuthal angle. The second and the third term of the right-hand-side 
changes the direction of the particles without changing the energy and the fourth 
term changes the energy of the particles without changing the direction (continuous 
slowing-down term). The continuous slowing down is used for the ``soft" interactions 
that result in small-energy losses. The catastrophic interactions that result in 
large energy losses are represented with the standard Boltzmann scattering. $\alpha$ 
is the restricted momentum transfer :
\begin{equation}
\alpha(E) = 2 \pi \int_0^E \int_{-1}^1 \Sigma_s(E\rightarrow E',\mu_0) (1-\mu_0) 
d\mu_0 dE
\end{equation}
with $\mu_0 = \mu'\mu+\sqrt{\(1-\mu'^2\)\(1-\mu^2\)} cos\(\phi'-\phi\)$ and $S$ is 
the restricted stopping power :
\begin{equation}
S(E) = 2\pi \int_0^{E} \int_{-1}^{1} \Sigma_s(E\rightarrow E') \(E-E'\)d\mu_0 dE'
\end{equation}
The restricted stopping power is defined as the portion of the total stopping
power which is not due to catastrophic collisions.\\
It is important to notice that the term :
$\frac{\alpha}{2}\(\frac{\partial}{\partial \mu}\(1-\mu^2\)\frac{\partial
\Psi}{\partial \mu}+\frac{1}{1-\mu^2}\frac{\partial^2\Psi}{\partial \phi}\)$ is very 
close to zero when $\mu \neq 1$. Thus, this term can be replace by
$\int_{-1}^1 c\delta(\mu-1) \Psi d\mu$. The equation can be rewritten as : 
\begin{equation}
\bo \cdot \bn \Psi + \Sigma_t \Psi = \int_{4\pi}\int_0^{\infty} \Sigma_s\(\bo
\cdot \bo',E'\rightarrow E\) \Psi(\bo',E')dE'd\bo' + \int_{-1}^1 c
\delta(\mu-1) \Psi d\mu + \frac{\partial}{\partial E}\beta \Psi + Q
\label{solved}
\end{equation}
The two extra-terms in the equation \ref{solved} can be either treated explicitly
or they can be treated in the cross sections. The latter was done in the CEPXS
code which produces cross sections for photons and electrons transport \cite{cepxs}. 
In this work, we will use the cross section produced by CEPXS to compute the coupled 
photon-electron transport. Unlike \cite{acuros}, we do not assume that the electrons 
do not produce photons. The system is fully coupled meaning that photons produce 
electrons and electrons produce photons. Thus, there are some upscattering 
terms in the scattering matrix even if there is not upscattering physically.\\
Now we will focus on the scattering term assuming that this quantity has been
integrated over the \hbox{energy :}
\begin{equation}
S = \int_{4\pi} \Sigma_s \(\bo \cdot \bo'\) \Psi\(\bo'\) d\bo' + \int_{-1}^1
c\delta (\mu-1) \Psi d\mu
\label{scattering}
\end{equation}
In a $S_n$ code, it is usual to write the discretized scattering source 
(\ref{scattering}) a product of 3 \hbox{matrices \cite{graal} :}
\begin{equation}
\bs{S} = M \Sigma D \bs{\Psi}
\end{equation}
where $\bs{\Psi}$ is a vector containing all the flux moments, $D$ is the
discrete-to-moment matrix which maps a vector of discrete angular flux values
to a corresponding vector of flux moments, $\Sigma$ is the scattering matrix
which contains the moments of the scattering cross sections on its diagonal, and 
$M$ is the moment-to-discrete matrix which maps a vector of flux moments to a 
corresponding vector of discrete angular flux values. The Galerkin quadrature 
requires that :
\begin{equation}
M = D^{-1}
\end{equation}
and therefore, $M$ and $D$ have to be square, which implies that the number of
moments is equal to the number of directions.\\
We want to use the Galerkin quadrature because it integrates exactly a delta
function scattering. Let's assume that :
\begin{equation}
\Sigma(\mu) = \delta(\mu-1)
\end{equation}
It is obvious that :
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
S &= \int_{-1}^1 \delta(\mu-1) \Psi(\mu) d\mu\\
&= \Psi
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Because $P_l(1)=1$ for all $l$, all expansion coefficients for the delta
function are equal to unity, and the cross-section matrix is the identity
matrix. We get :
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\bs{S} &= MD\bs{\Psi}\\
&= \bs{\Psi}\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
