\section{MEMORY ISSUES}
In the previous section, we showed that one should employ a Galerkin quadrature to solve
(\ref{solved}) correctly. This may be a significant issue in terms of memory
requirements. For neutron transport, the scattering is less anisotropic than 
for electron transport, and therefore, fewer flux moments than angular 
fluxes are needed. This is the reason why the information is usually stored as 
flux moments. However, Galerkin quadratures require the number of moments 
to be equal to the number of directions. This requirement is very restrictive and it 
is important to explore whether it is possible to decrease the number of moments 
while maintaining a larger number of directions. In \cite{mem}, the authors used a 
Legendre expansion of the scattering cross section with an order lower than that required by the 
Galerkin quadrature. They have shown a good agreement between their results 
and Monte-Carlo simulations. In the next section, we study the effects of
truncating the Legendre expansion while keeping a larger number of angular 
fluxes than the order of the scattering expansion. We proceed by building 
the matrices $M$ and $D$ using a Galerkin quadrature, then truncate them 
to keep only a few moments. Therefore, $M$ and $D$ are rectangular instead 
of square matrices and a truncated scattering expansion can be used. 
We show the results for two materials, Al and Au, and for different Legendre 
expansions.
