\section{CONCLUSIONS}
In this paper, we have shown that it is not necessary to keep the full order of
the scattering cross sections to obtain an accurate result while solving
photon-electron transport. Truncating the Galerkin quadrature or equivalently
truncating the scattering expansion while keeping a large number of directions 
allows us to significantly decrease the memory requirements. We also presented a 
method to advantageously reorder the energy groups in the scattering matrix. 
The groups can be reordered in such a way that a problem with $n_p$ groups of 
photons and $n_e$ groups of electrons can be rewritten as $gcd$ problems of 
$\frac{n_p+n_e}{gcd}$ groups, where $gcd$ is the greatest common divisor 
between $n_p$ and $n_e$. The reordering also decreases the number of iterations 
needed to solve the multigroup transport equation. These two methods can 
significantly decrease the memory needed to solve coupled photon/electron 
transport problems.
