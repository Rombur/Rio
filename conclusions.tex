\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we have shown that it is not necessary to keep the full order of
the scattering cross sections to obtain an accurate answer while solving
photon-electron transport. Truncating the Galerkin quadrature allows us to
decrease significantly the memory needs. We also presented a method to
advantageously reorder the energy groups in the scattering matrix. The groups can 
be reordered in such a way that a problem with $n_p$ groups of photons and $n_e$ 
groups of electrons can be rewritten as $gcd$ problems of $\frac{n_p+n_e}{gcd}$ 
groups, where $gcd$ is the greatest common divisor between $n_p$ and $n_e$.
The reordering also decreases the number of iterations needed to solve the
multigroup transport equation.
These two methods combined allow to decrease significantly the memory needed to 
solve electron transport.
