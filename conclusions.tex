\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we have shown that it is not necessary to keep the full order of
the scattering cross sections to keep an accurate answer while solving
electron transport. The Galerkin quadrature can be truncated. This allows us to
decrease significantly the memory need. We also presented a method to
advantageously reorder the energy groups in the scattering matrix. The groups can 
be reorder in such a way that a problem with $n_p$ groups of photons and $n_e$ 
groups of electrons can be rewritten as $gcd$ problems of $\frac{n_p+n_e}{gcd}$ 
groups, where $gcd$ is the greatest common divisor between $n_p$ and $n_e$. 
These two methods combined allow to decrease significantly the memory needed to 
solve electron transport.
